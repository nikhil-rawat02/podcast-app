I understand what you're looking for. To achieve this effect, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here are some hints to help you get started:

Create an HTML structure with a container element that holds both the video and an overlay element.
Use CSS to position the video and overlay elements within the container. Set the video element to position: absolute and the overlay element to position: relative.
Apply a linear gradient to the overlay element using CSS. The gradient should start with a dark color on the left and gradually fade to transparent.
Use JavaScript to detect when the video has played 1/3 of its duration. You can do this by adding an event listener to the video element and listening for the timeupdate event.
When the video reaches 1/3 of its duration, use JavaScript to update the CSS of the overlay element, changing the gradient to be fully transparent.

I hope these hints help you create the desired effect. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
